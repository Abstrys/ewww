<center><h2>About the Ewww Web Server</h2></center>

The Ewww Web Server is written in <a href="http://sun.java.com/">Java</a> and
was designed to be a very simple web-server for demonstration and learning
purposes.<p/>

It was originally written in 2005, on a lark and in less than an hour, by
<a href="mailto:eron@abstrys.com">Eron Hennessey</a>.  The name <b>Ewww</b> might be an
acronym meaning "Eron's Weird World Web-server", or it just might be an
expression of how <i>disgustingly</i> simple this code is.  ;)<p/>

An <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache Ant</a> script for building the code
was added later, as was this "About" page.<p/>

Ewww is free software, and is released exclusively under the terms of the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.
A copy of the license was provided with this software in the file
